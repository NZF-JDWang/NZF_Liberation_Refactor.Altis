# Arma 3 SQF Refactoring Rules

## Function Scope and Testing
- Work on one function at a time to ensure proper testing between changes
- After refactoring a function, stop and wait for approval before proceeding to the next
- Analyze function dependencies before changing any code to understand potential impacts
- Do not create new functions 

## Code Formatting
- Use 4-space indentation consistently throughout all files
- Place opening and closing braces on their own lines
- Keep line length under 120 characters when possible
- Use consistent spacing around operators: `a = b` instead of `a=b`
- Always use semicolons to terminate statements

## Function Headers
- Every function must include a standardized header:
```
/*
    Function: function_name
    
    Description:
        Brief description of what the function does
    
    Parameters:
        _param1 - Description of parameter 1
        _param2 - Description of parameter 2
    
    Returns:
        What the function returns, if anything
    
    Examples:
        (begin example)
        _result = [_param1, _param2] call function_name
        (end)

```

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable names with Hungarian notation (prefix with underscore for local variables)
- Avoid inline functions in favor of separate function definitions
- Group related variables together with comments explaining their purpose
- Explicitly return values with the `exitWith` command or at the end of the function
- Use descriptive comments for complex logic or non-obvious code sections

## Variable Naming
- Use camelCase for variable names
- Prefix local variables with underscore (_variableName)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Use descriptive and specific names that explain the purpose

## Error Prevention
- Use the `params` command for function parameters with type checking where possible
- Include error handling for important functions
- Check if variables exist before attempting to use them
- Avoid using global variables when possible
- Use proper scoping (private, private _varName = value;)

## Documentation and Comments
- Comment any complex logic or non-obvious code
- Document all function parameters and return values
- Include examples of function usage where helpful
- Add TODO comments for future improvements
- Use block comments for large sections and line comments for single lines

## Code Organization
- Keep related functions in the same file
- Organize code in a logical manner with similar functionality grouped together
- Separate UI functions from logic functions when possible
- Follow ACE3 and CBA best practices for compatibility

## Testing Considerations
- Ensure changes maintain backward compatibility
- Test functions after refactoring to verify functionality
- Verify impact on performance for frequently called functions
