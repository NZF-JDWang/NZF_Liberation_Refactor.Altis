# NZF Liberation Refactoring Progress

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored diagnostics.sqf
- Replaced waitUntil and sleep with CBA functions
- Replaced infinite while loop with CBA_fnc_addPerFrameHandler
- Converted to unscheduled execution model using CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Added player count to diagnostics log
- Improved performance by eliminating blocking calls
- Removed unnecessary log entries (CBA, ACE, KP Ranks)

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored kill_manager.sqf
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitAndExecute and CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Consolidated redundant code into a single kill processing function
- Optimized ACE integration by removing redundant checks (assuming ACE is always loaded)
- Improved error handling with proper timeout for ACE killer data
- Implemented two-phase body cleanup (hide then delete) using CBA non-blocking functions
- Reduced code size by approximately 60% while maintaining all functionality

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored kill_manager.sqf and fn_spawnVehicle.sqf

### Changes:
- Updated kill_manager.sqf to use CBA non-blocking functions
- Updated fn_spawnVehicle.sqf to use non-blocking event handlers
- Added proper documentation for both files

### TODO for kill_manager:
- All remaining event handlers in the following files need to be updated to use the new pattern:
```
unit addMPEventHandler ["MPKilled", {[{_this call kill_manager}, _this] call CBA_fnc_directCall}];
```

- File list to update:
  - scripts/server/secondary/search_and_rescue.sqf
  - scripts/server/patrols/send_paratroopers.sqf
  - scripts/server/patrols/manage_one_civilian_patrol.sqf
  - scripts/server/game/save_manager.sqf
  - scripts/server/battlegroup/spawn_air.sqf
  - scripts/client/init_client.sqf
  - scripts/client/build/do_build.sqf
  - functions/fn_createManagedUnit.sqf
  - functions/fn_handlePlacedZeusObject.sqf

### Benefits:
- Improved performance by eliminating unnecessary spawns
- Better adheres to CBA/ACE3 best practices
- More maintainable and consistent codebase

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored add_defense_waypoints.sqf

### Changes:
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute for non-blocking execution
- Fixed parameter handling to properly accept both groups and vehicles
- Added proper function header and documentation
- Improved waypoint logic with a local function for waypoint clearing
- Fixed calls in manage_one_sector.sqf to use call instead of spawn

### Benefits:
- Script now works properly in both scheduled and unscheduled environments
- Maintains the same functionality while adhering to CBA best practices
- More maintainable and better documented code

## 2024-03-22 - Refactored manage_one_sector.sqf and wait_to_spawn_sector.sqf

### Changes:
- Converted manage_one_sector.sqf to use CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute instead of waitUntil loops
- Replaced spawn commands with CBA_fnc_directCall where appropriate
- Fixed wait_to_spawn_sector.sqf to properly use CBA functions for non-blocking execution
- Added proper error handling and documentation
- Improved sector spawning logic to be more reliable

### Benefits:
- Enhanced server performance by eliminating blocking code
- Reduced script execution times for sector management
- More predictable sector AI behavior
- Eliminated potential race conditions
