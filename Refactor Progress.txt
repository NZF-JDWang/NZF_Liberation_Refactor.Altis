- Added player count to diagnostics log
- Improved performance by eliminating blocking calls
- Removed unnecessary log entries (CBA, ACE, KP Ranks)

## 2024-06-XX - Refactored kill_manager.sqf
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitAndExecute and CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Consolidated redundant code into a single kill processing function
- Optimized ACE integration by removing redundant checks (assuming ACE is always loaded)
- Improved error handling with proper timeout for ACE killer data
- Implemented two-phase body cleanup (hide then delete) using CBA non-blocking functions
- Reduced code size by approximately 60% while maintaining all functionality
