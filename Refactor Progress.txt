## 2024-10-15 - Refactored fn_spawnVehicle.sqf
- Updated to use non-blocking event handlers
- Added proper documentation with standardized function header

- Optimized vehicle spawning logic

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored add_defense_waypoints.sqf
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitAndExecute and CBA_fnc_addPerFrameHandler
- Fixed parameter handling to properly accept both groups and vehicles
- Added proper function header and documentation
- Improved waypoint logic with a local function for waypoint clearing

## 2024-10-15 - Enhanced add_defense_waypoints.sqf with LAMBS
- Implemented LAMBS waypoint system integration (patrol, garrison, camp)
- Added dynamic behavior selection based on unit type (infantry vs. vehicles)
- Created weighted random selection of tactics for infantry units (patrol/garrison/camp)
- Added fallback to vanilla waypoints when LAMBS is not available
- Improved combat response with LAMBS taskRush and taskHunt for better enemy engagement
- Expanded patrol radius for vehicles to reflect their mobility
- Modified waypoint behavior to be more tactically sound

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored manage_one_sector.sqf
