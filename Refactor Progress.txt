# NZF Liberation Refactoring Progress

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored diagnostics.sqf
- Replaced waitUntil and sleep with CBA functions
- Replaced infinite while loop with CBA_fnc_addPerFrameHandler
- Converted to unscheduled execution model using CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Added player count to diagnostics log
- Improved performance by eliminating blocking calls
- Removed unnecessary log entries (CBA, ACE, KP Ranks)

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored kill_manager.sqf
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitAndExecute and CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Consolidated redundant code into a single kill processing function
- Optimized ACE integration by removing redundant checks (assuming ACE is always loaded)
- Improved error handling with proper timeout for ACE killer data
- Implemented two-phase body cleanup (hide then delete) using CBA non-blocking functions
- Reduced code size by approximately 60% while maintaining all functionality

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored fn_spawnVehicle.sqf
- Updated to use non-blocking event handlers
- Added proper documentation with standardized function header
- Improved error handling and parameter validation
- Optimized vehicle spawning logic

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored add_defense_waypoints.sqf
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitAndExecute and CBA_fnc_addPerFrameHandler
- Fixed parameter handling to properly accept both groups and vehicles
- Added proper function header and documentation
- Improved waypoint logic with a local function for waypoint clearing
- Fixed calls in manage_one_sector.sqf to use call instead of spawn

## 2024-10-15 - Enhanced add_defense_waypoints.sqf with LAMBS
- Implemented LAMBS waypoint system integration (patrol, garrison, camp)
- Added dynamic behavior selection based on unit type (infantry vs. vehicles)
- Created weighted random selection of tactics for infantry units (patrol/garrison/camp)
- Added fallback to vanilla waypoints when LAMBS is not available
- Improved combat response with LAMBS taskRush and taskHunt for better enemy engagement
- Expanded patrol radius for vehicles to reflect their mobility
- Modified waypoint behavior to be more tactically sound

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored manage_one_sector.sqf
- Converted all waitUntil loops to CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Replaced sleep commands with CBA_fnc_waitAndExecute
- Converted sector lifetime loop to CBA_fnc_addPerFrameHandler
- Restructured code into smaller functions for improved readability
- Properly encapsulated sector configuration and unit spawning
- Implemented non-blocking sector cleanup and liberation handling
- Ensured proper variable scoping and reduced global variable usage
- Added comprehensive function documentation header

## 2024-10-16 - Fixed vehicle despawning in manage_one_sector.sqf
- Enhanced cleanup logic to ensure all vehicle crews are deleted properly
- Improved vehicle cleanup to delete the crew before the vehicle itself
- Added tracking and deletion of empty AI groups after unit deletion
- Implemented better handling of unmanaged vehicles in the sector area
- Added detailed logging for tracking despawn issues
- Fixed issues with vehicle crews remaining after sector deactivation
- Enhanced logging with unit counts for infantry, vehicles, and groups
- Added safeguards against null references in unit arrays

## 2024-03-22 - Refactored wait_to_spawn_sector.sqf
- Converted to use CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute instead of waitUntil loops
- Added proper error handling and parameter validation
- Improved sector spawning reliability
- Enhanced performance by eliminating blocking calls
