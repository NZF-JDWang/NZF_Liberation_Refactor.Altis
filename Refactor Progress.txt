# NZF Liberation Refactoring Progress

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored diagnostics.sqf
- Replaced waitUntil and sleep with CBA functions
- Replaced infinite while loop with CBA_fnc_addPerFrameHandler
- Converted to unscheduled execution model using CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Added player count to diagnostics log
- Improved performance by eliminating blocking calls
- Removed unnecessary log entries (CBA, ACE, KP Ranks)

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored kill_manager.sqf
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitAndExecute and CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute
- Consolidated redundant code into a single kill processing function
- Optimized ACE integration by removing redundant checks (assuming ACE is always loaded)
- Improved error handling with proper timeout for ACE killer data
- Implemented two-phase body cleanup (hide then delete) using CBA non-blocking functions
- Reduced code size by approximately 60% while maintaining all functionality

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored fn_spawnVehicle.sqf
- Updated to use non-blocking event handlers
- Added proper documentation with standardized function header
- Improved error handling and parameter validation
- Optimized vehicle spawning logic

## 2024-10-15 - Refactored add_defense_waypoints.sqf
- Replaced sleep and waitUntil with CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute for non-blocking execution
- Fixed parameter handling to properly accept both groups and vehicles
- Added proper function header and documentation
- Improved waypoint logic with a local function for waypoint clearing
- Fixed calls in manage_one_sector.sqf to use call instead of spawn

## 2024-03-22 - Refactored wait_to_spawn_sector.sqf
- Converted to use CBA_fnc_waitUntilAndExecute instead of waitUntil loops
- Added proper error handling and parameter validation
- Improved sector spawning reliability
- Enhanced performance by eliminating blocking calls

## TODO for kill_manager:
- All remaining event handlers in the following files need to be updated to use the new pattern:
```
unit addMPEventHandler ["MPKilled", {[{_this call kill_manager}, _this] call CBA_fnc_directCall}];
```
