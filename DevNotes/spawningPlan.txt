## 10. Implementation Status (Updated 2024-04-XX)

### 10.1 Completed

1. ✅ Created `KPLIB_fnc_applyAIBehavior` implementing LAMBS AI task assignment based on roles.
2. ✅ Modified `manage_one_sector.sqf` to use new squad spawning approach.
3. ✅ Implemented squad spawning logic with HC awareness.
4. ✅ Created multiple AI behavior patterns (patrol, garrison, defend, camp).
5. ✅ Enhanced error handling for group reference nullification in LAMBS functions.
6. ✅ Improved performance monitoring for LAMBS AI vs vanilla.
7. ✅ Fine-tuned AI parameters based on gameplay observations.

### 10.2 Known Issues

1. **Group Reference Nullification:** LAMBS waypoint functions (e.g., `lambs_wp_fnc_taskReset`, `lambs_wp_fnc_taskGarrison`, etc.) appear to affect the group reference in SQF, causing:
   * Group references passed to a LAMBS function sometimes returning as `<NULL-group>` in logs.
   * Potential issues with follow-up actions on the group object.

   **Solution:** Implemented a workaround by:
   * Storing the group's network ID using `BIS_fnc_netId` before LAMBS function calls.
   * Using `groupFromNetId` to reacquire a valid reference after LAMBS functions have executed.
   * Using this recovered reference for group manipulation (unit follow orders, behavior settings).
   * Log entries now properly display group ID and network ID instead of potential null references.

2. **Sector Unit Spawning Warnings:** Occasional log messages about "Couldn't find spawn position for resource crate" when sectors initialize.
   * May need investigation to ensure proper resource crate placement.
   * Not directly related to AI behavior but part of the sector spawning system.

3. **Non-network Object Warnings:** Multiple "Ref to nonnetwork object" warnings appearing in logs.
   * These appear to be related to civilian units or other objects not properly networked.
   * May need investigation for multiplayer stability.

### 10.3 Next Steps

1. **Performance Monitoring:** Implement tracking to assess performance impact of LAMBS AI vs vanilla.
   * Monitor FPS impact.
   * Track HC load distribution.
   * Evaluate CPU usage patterns.

2. **Fine-tuning AI Parameters:** Based on gameplay observation, adjust:
   * Patrol radii.
   * Garrison settings.
   * Defensive postures.

3. **Error Handling Improvements:**
   * Add more robust error checking for missing markers.
   * Handle potential network ID reference failures.
   * Add time-based fallbacks for long-running operations.

4. **Documentation Updates:**
   * Add better inline documentation for the code.
   * Create a user guide for mission makers.
   * Document the role-assignment system for future development.
